    q: "How fast can you deliver a custom AI system?",
    a: "Most projects are live within 2-4 weeks. For more complex builds, we can often have a proof of concept running in under a week, allowing you to see it in action before committing to the full rollout."
  },
  {
    q: "Who owns the developed AI systems?",
    a: "Yes - you retain full ownership of the solution and how it’s used within your business. We build systems either within your existing tools or manage them on your behalf, depending on what’s most effective. You’ll always have full visibility, with the option for handover if required."
  },
  {
    q: "How does pricing work?",
    a: "It depends entirely on what you need. After our discovery call, we'll put together a custom pricing structure that fits your project scope and the specific outcomes you're looking for."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to change my current software or retrain my staff?",
    a: "No. We plug directly into your existing systems and workflows. Our goal is to reduce friction—not create more by forcing you to adopt new software."
  },
  {
    q: "What do you need from us to start building?",
    a: "We just need access to your tools, any existing training materials or SOPs, and ideally a few examples of how your best people currently handle the processes we are automating."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide ongoing support?",
    a: "Absolutely. That's what our managed service covers—fixing bugs, making adjustments, swapping tools, and ensuring everything runs smoothly 24/7. We are your long-term partner, not a one-and-done shop."
  },
  {
    q: "How do we know the AI is accurate?",
    a: "Every system we build includes a full, auditable data trail. You can see exactly where each piece of information came from without having to re-check the sources yourself."
